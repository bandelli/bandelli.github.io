A while back my Google Chrome start to show fonts of Google's Product and other sites with a fail details.
I read some articles on the web that Google´s font  Roboto could to suffer some incompatibility somethimes with own Google, and after some research and debug, I finally solved my problem.


## And how did I get it?

The solution that worked in my case was to find out what is the Font that was with problem (was Roboto) and delete it of my windows´s System Operation.
To find that, I used the own Chrome inspector to debug.

Besides this procdimento, I also did the configuration of ClearType just for precaution.
